#**📊 Customer Spending Analysis**

This project demonstrates data visualization using Matplotlib in Python.
The scenario focuses on analyzing customer spending patterns in a retail store.

**🔍 Problem Statement**

A retail store wants to analyze customer spending data to gain insights into:

Spending behavior over multiple visits

Spending patterns across age groups

Payment mode preferences

Distribution of bill amounts

**🛠️ Visualizations Included**

The following visualizations are created using Matplotlib:

Line Chart – Customer spending over 10 visits

Uses linewidth, color, marker, and grid lines

Horizontal Bar Chart – Spending comparison by different age groups

Uses barh with custom colors and labels

Pie Chart – Distribution of payment modes (Cash, Card, UPI)

Uses autopct, shadow=True, colors, and startangle

Histogram – Distribution of average bill amounts

Uses bins, edgecolor, and color

Subplot Grid (2×2) – Combined dashboard showing all the above charts

**💡 Key Learnings**

Basics of Matplotlib plotting

Using line, bar, pie, and histogram charts

Working with subplots (2×2 grid)

Customizing plots with colors, markers, labels, legends, and gridlines

**✨ Future Scope**

Extend analysis using Seaborn for advanced visualizations

Use real-world datasets (CSV files) instead of sample data

Create an interactive dashboard with Plotly
